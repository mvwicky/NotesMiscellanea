# NotesMiscellanea
A repo of notes that I make occasionally, including a tex file that attempts to compile them all

## Contents:
### Folders:
- AES_Rijndael: contains source for a `c` implementation of the AES algorithm
- coreutils-8.25: contains source for the GNU `coreutils` programs, e.g., `cp`, `ls`, `rm`, etc.
- md5: contains source, in `c` and pseudo-code, for the md5 hashing algorithm
- MVW_Portfolio: contains source for a tentative portfolio website design along with a design tool 
- ncc-2.8: contains source for the ncc project
- Notes_File: contains the LaTeX for the notes that I make on various subjects
